        <p>Every year when Worlds comes around, I catch myself doing the same thing — wondering what skin I'd pick if I
            won. What champion would I choose? What colors? What story would I want the skin to tell?
            This project is basically that thought, but visual. I picked a few of my favorite champions and imagined
            what their Worlds skins could look like — using real team colors as a base and mixing in my own ideas and
            style. No client, no brief, just something I’ve always wanted to see for myself.
            Below you'll find the splash art, my moodboard, and a breakdown of how I got there — from sketch to final.
